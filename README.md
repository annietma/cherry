### Running (on XCode Simulator)
Note: This app was 'expo eject'd so you need to use expo run:ios instead of expo start.

To start the app simply run this chain of commands (you need npm previously installed):
```git clone https://github.com/annietma/cherry && cd cherry/ && git checkout dev && npm install && expo run:ios```



### Limitations
1. Communication with other users is faked, except for the reply function when reading responses.
2. Audio Response: No voice recording functionality (expo limitation).
3. Question Bank is hardcoded and limited in size.
4. Rapid Fire back and forth responses are staged.
