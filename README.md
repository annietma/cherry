### Running (on XCode Simulator)
Note: This app was 'expo eject'd so you need to use expo run:ios instead of expo start.

To start the app simply run this chain of commands (you need npm previously installed):
```git clone https://github.com/annietma/cherry && cd cherry/ && git checkout dev && npm install && expo run:ios```

### Limitations
1. Communication with other users is faked
2. Audio Response: No voice recording functionality (expo limitation)
3. Picture Response: No camera in-app functionality, but can upload photos from camera roll
4. Question Bank is hardcoded and limited in size.
